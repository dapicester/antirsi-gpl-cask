# AntiRSI GPL

This is the old version released under the GPL license.
The binary is still available for downloadi from the homepage.
The source code is available on GitHub:
  https://github.com/onnlucky/antirsi

# Why this?

A pull request for AntiRSI was rejected:

https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/1497

So instead of trying again, I just created my personal tap.
